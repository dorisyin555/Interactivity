Two circles are going to be interacting

how you will know– or, more accurately, how you will describe to the computer which conditions the variables that represent those objects need to be in to consider that– the objects are 
touching
what will happen when the objects touch. A simple statement is fine "they will bounce off one another," but I'd recommend you give it some programmatic thought: "I will swap the dx and 
dy variables for each object"
